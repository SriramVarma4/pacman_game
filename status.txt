Status of current game:

It is a two player game but does not use the sockets.
Two players can play in a common window.
One player uses up, down, left, right
Other uses W, A, S, D for playing.

At each gameplay a different random maze is created.

There are two difficulty levels.
Based on the difficulty the number of ghosts change

In easy mode there is one ghost chasing each pacman.
In hard mode there are two ghosts for each pacman.

When a pacman is caught by ghost.
It will not be able to collect coins.
It becomes a ghost.
Now it can chase the other pacman, kill it.

When both pacman die the score of each pacman is shown.

We go back to the home page.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////

We tried implementing sockets but we faced problem in 
transfering the data continuously.

Our plan using sockets was:

1)At the beginning sending the maze structure using sockets.
  i.e., the coordinates and dimensions of the rectangles for maze.

2)Then during playing we would send just transfer the coordinates of
  the ghosts and pacman.
  
3)The handling of the rendering and movement of pacman will be done locally.
